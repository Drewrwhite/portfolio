          <p>
            My name is Drew (he/him), and I currently live in Portland, Oregon.
            I am a full time student, studying Data Engineering at
            <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>, a tech bootcamp.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I do have experience with tech, I have never worked in the
            tech industry. I currently own a barber shop and have been barbering
            for close to 10 years. I have recently stepped back to be just an
            owner and manage things. Having had a desire to work in the tech
            industry for year, I decided it is time to pursue those dreams!
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy making and listening to music, doing Danzan
            Ryu Ju Jitsu, and spending time in the beautiful outdoors exploring
            with my wife and two daughters.
