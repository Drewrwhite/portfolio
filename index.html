          <h2 class="card-title">About Me:</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Drew (he/him), and I currently live in Portland, Oregon.
            I am a full time student, studying Data Engineering at
            <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>, a tech bootcamp.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I do have experience with tech, I have never worked in the
            tech industry. I currently own a barber shop and have been barbering
            for close to 10 years. I have recently stepped back to be just an
            owner and manage things. Having had a desire to work in the tech
            industry for year, I decided it is time to pursue those dreams!
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy making and listening to music, doing Danzan
            Ryu Ju Jitsu, and spending time in the beautiful outdoors exploring
            with my wife and two daughters.

              open to everything. In the beginner's mind there are many
              possibilities, but in the expert's mind there are few. ”
